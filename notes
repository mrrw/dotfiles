OK, so, here's my attempt to organize my thoughts.  What to do?

My wife is not a Christian anymore.  She finally realized that not only can't she trust the bible, she doesn't even trust the red letters.  Jesus is crazy or bad.  I don't know what to do with this, but I do know that I have been seeing through the garbage that Christians spout.  I have not made a decision about Jesus yet, but I can't imagine that hell is real.  It just seems so counter to a loving Creator.  Reincarnation makes more sense than hell.  

I owe it to myself to explore Jesus's words once and for all.  So, I will be using my newfound technological haven's to document my studies.  

My mission:  To read all four gospels and break up each piece into it's consituant parts, developing my opinion on each piece from two perspectives:
1) my understanding of scripture as a whole, and;
2) logic and reason

I simply cannot stand by and choose ignorance any longer.  I must know.

We will lose friends over this.  We will be seen as lost.  We will no longer be trusted.  This is going to hurt.
