ugh.  After so much time playing with Arch Linux, I'm feeling frustrated.  I have this badass computer, but can't do anything on it because...  it's not ready.  I have to manually install and configure everything.  That's cool, but MAN it's hard.  Here's a rant about some of these frustrations.

Fonts are ugly.  Windows/panes are ugly.  Github needs a crazy password, but LastPass doesn't seem to work.  I have no clipboard.  Xmonad broke for 2 weeks, and life in the terminal ain't pretty.  Tmux is cool, but I don't know the first thing about ssh'ing into it, not to mention getting wifi on the laptop in the first place.  w3m is cool but impossible on many modern sites.  Wordprocessing in vim is ugly.  Colors are ugly.  Did I mention fonts are ugly?  Xmonad takes forever to configure as Haskell is difficult to learn and xinitrc confuses me.  Email = mutt = what?!  

Ugh.  I'm just so tired.  Would I use windows if I could? Probably.  But Windows 7 on my dad's laptop is ultra-slow, and windows XP on my super-old PC is right out.  Also, damn windoze: propriatery, bloated, patronizing, un-customizable, hurts the hands, garbage.  I hate it.  I want a lean mean machine, using well-excecuted open-code tools.  My fucking brain hurts.
